# Ford Responsive Framework (FRF) Starter Application
Congratulations on generating your FRF Starter based application. Please see the following information on how to utilize this framework. To keep up-to-date with the latest versions the FRF, you can follow the [frf-starter repository](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/frf-starter) and our [migration guides](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/migration).

## Getting Started with the Ford Responsive Framework

‚ö†Ô∏è üì¢ As this release of FRF switches from Nexus to JFrog Artifactory, it's critical that you follow the [npm Installation and Configuration Guide](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/node-and-npm/npm%20installation%20and%20configuration) again, in step 2i below - even if you have done so in the past.

To get started with your PADB app, you will need to do the following:
1. Pull down a copy of this release using your preferred method (.zip download, HTTPS/SSH clone). Place it somewhere convenient.
1. Newer versions of Node.js requires that Ford keep track of all users due to licensing requirements. Visit the [Node.js usage tracking page](https://azureford.sharepoint.com/sites/WebCOE/Pages/Node.js.aspx) to complete the form
   1. Install Node.js v18.x on your computer via Volta, the JavaScript tool manager; Follow the [npm Installation and Configuration Guide](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/node-and-npm/npm%20installation%20and%20configuration) to also setup and configure support for JFrog Artifactory.
1. Configure command-line proxy settings appropriately - read more in [the Proxy Developer Guide](https://centralstation.ford.com/docs/default/component/spring-boot-dev-guides/proxy-configuration).
	1.  Locations where environmental variables are often set can include the following:
		1.  macOS:
			- Bash`.bashrc`,`.bash_profile`, and /or `.profile`
			- Zsh: `.zshrc` and /or `.profile`
		1.  Windows
			- PowerShell: `Profile.ps1`
			- Git Bash: `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, and /or `.profile`
1. Open a terminal/command prompt inside of the project.
1. Run `npm install`<sup>1</sup>.
1. Run `npm update @wame/blue-oval-theme @wame/ngx-adfs @wame/ngx-frf-utilities` to get the latest compatible version of the [blue-oval-theme](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/primeng-designer/blob/main/src/sass/README.md), [ngx-adfs](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/frf-packages/blob/main/projects/ngx-adfs/README.md) and [ngx-frf-utilities](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/frf-packages/blob/main/projects/ngx-frf-utilities/README.md)
1. Start your local development server with `npm run start-local` 
1. Finally, visit http://localhost:9500 to see your rendered app in the browser

<sup>1</sup> For more information on `npm install` and how to keep up to date with the latest package versions, see the [NPM Version Management guide](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/blob/main/node-and-npm/npm-version-management.md).

## Theming your Application
This project utilizes [PrimeNG Sass Theme](https://github.com/primefaces/primeng-sass-theme), and a theme created by the Web Enablement team called the `blue-oval-theme`. These theme files are located within the `@wame/blue-oval-theme` npm package.

For more information and instructions on theme setup please refer to the [Blue Oval Theme Setup Guide](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/primeng-designer/blob/v16.1.0/src/sass/README.md).

Note that this 16.x release of `frf-starter` only works with the [16.x release of our PrimeNG Designer Showcase theme](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/primeng-designer/tree/v16.1.0).
This is due to changes in structure and variables additions/removals that occur between PrimeNG Designer releases. Newer releases of PrimeNG Designer may work with older `frf-starter` releases, but are not recommended nor officially supported.

### A Note on Accessibility
Accessibility is of the utmost importance to us. Developing an accessible application means making it usable to everyone, including those with visual, hearing, motor, and cognitive impairments.  We follow Ford Motor Company's minimum accessibility standards, which are based on the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.  For more general information on accessibility, see the [Accessibilty for Developers guide](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/web-accessibility).

## Continuous Integration (CI)
### Tekton
Version 16.x of `frf-starter` includes support for Tekton pipelines-as-code (PaC) for CI and CD to GCP. You can find the pipeline files in the `.tekton/` directory, and instructions on how to configure what is included in [our frf-tekton-pipelines repo](https://github.com/ford-innersource/devenablement.wame.frf-tekton-pipelines/tree/v16.1.0).

### Jenkins
Additionally, we still have a modified version of the [EcoBoost Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/ford-innersource/devenablement.cloudnative.ecoboost-jenkins-pipeline) for deployment to PCF. For more information on the WaME Jenkins pipeline, see our [dev guides for Jenkins Pipeline implementations](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/blob/main/jenkins/README.md). Please note that while we still have this available to use, it is effectively deprecated and will not receive further updates.

For more information about Jenkins itself, take a look at the [Jenkins pages managed by the SDE team](https://azureford.sharepoint.com/sites/SDE/SitePages/Jenkins/SDE-Jenkins-overview.aspx).


## Other Libraries and Features
This starter project is designed to be an empty scaffold to help kickstart your development efforts. To that end, it deliberately only includes the minimum set of dependencies required to be effective. There are other libraries, such as Chart.js (dynamic charting), NGXS (reactive-style state management), and some others that are approved for use but are not included here. For further information, contact wamcoe@ford.com.

## Notable Changes on Each Release
We document the changelog for each release of this starter project in [our GitHub repository's Release Notes](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/frf-starter/releases). There, you'll find not only the list of feature commits that are included, but also a brief writeup and description of what changes with the release.

## Migrating from a Previous Release
Migrating to Angular 16.x is relatively simple if you are migrating from 15.x. For more information on version migrations between FRF releases, see the [MIGRATION.md docs](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/migration) in our Web DevGuides.  Like Google, we only support migrating from one major version to the next, never skipping major versions.

## Upcoming Releases and Version Support
This version of the `frf-starter` should be considered a snapshot in time view of the larger Angular ecosystem. We strive to keep this template up to date with the latest releases from the Angular team, but keep in mind that we also have cascading dependencies and implications to consider when it comes to our release cadence. For more information, review [our release documentation in RELEASE.md](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/frf-starter/blob/v16.1.0/.github/RELEASE.md).

When a new version of our frf-starter template is released, we strongly recommend that teams use the new frf-starter template version and the [MIGRATION.md docs](https://github.ford.com/WaMCOE/web-devguides/tree/main/migration) to keep their application up to date as soon as possible. Upgrading provides new feature enhancements and potential performance improvements, but perhaps more importantly, also ensures crucial security updates are applied and helps to eliminate technical debt.

In terms of version support, we track [the support policy and schedule that is published by the Angular team](https://angular.dev/reference/releases#support-policy-and-schedule). We do our best to keep up with the current Active releases mentioned there, but keep in mind that various external factors may cause us to stay on an earlier release beyond Active support and into Long-Term Support (LTS). We will always plan to provide updated frf-starter templates and migration guides before a specific version's LTS support by the Angular team ends. At a minimum, we recommend that teams ensure their application does not fall further behind than the provided LTS dates.

## Notes
-  For more details on the Angular 16.x release, take a look at the [Angular 16.0 release blog post](https://blog.angular.io/angular-v16-is-here-4d7a28ec680d).
 -  For more details on other breaking changes that could come up in your application, take a look at the [Angular Update Guide](https://update.angular.io/?l=2&v=15.0-16.0).
